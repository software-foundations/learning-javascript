# Array

- In fact, an array is an object
- There is no native array in javascript
- It can have heterogeneous values
- It is not fixed in size
- It is indexed by zero
- <code>arrObj.length</code> return the number of items in the array
- <code>arrObj.sort()</code> both sort and modifies the array
- <code>delete arrObj[index]</code> put <code>undefined</code> at index position
- <code>arrObj.splice()</code> adds or remove (or both at the same time) an item in an specific index
- <code>const arr = []</code> makes the reference, but not its value, constant
